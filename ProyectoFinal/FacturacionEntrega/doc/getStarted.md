# Get started

1. Clone this repository from GitHub using the following command:
   ```
   git clone <repository_url>
   ```

2. Open the cloned project in your favorite IDE, such as Visual Studio Code or IntelliJ IDEA.

3. Wait for a few minutes to allow the IDE to install the project dependencies. This process may vary depending on your IDE and internet speed.

4. Once all the dependencies are installed, navigate to the main class of the project `src/main/java/com/ferrari/FacturacionEntrega/FacturacionEntregaApplication.java` within your IDE.

5. Run the main class to start the server. This will initialize the API and make it ready to receive requests.

6. Open POSTMAN or a similar tool to test the API. You can send requests to the server using the provided endpoints for CRUD operations on clients and products, as well as creating and consulting invoices.

7. Additionally, you can access the H2 Console, which provides a user interface to interact with the H2 database used in the project. You can perform queries and view the stored data by accessing http://localhost:8888/h2-console.
